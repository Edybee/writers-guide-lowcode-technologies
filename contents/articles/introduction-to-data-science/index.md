## Introduction
Data science is all about extracting knowledge and insights from data. 
Data science techniques have become more and more relevant in the world as we know it.
it is used in major applications like Netflix, Google, Amazon and so many more it’s also used for research purposes. 
if you wish to enter the Data science world here is a brief tutorial on a machine learning methods.
## The stages of Data Science
These are the different stages that data scientist partake when working on  to extract knowledge from data. To extract this information,
they employ various fit-to-purpose models based on machine learning algorithms, statistics, and mathematical methods.

### Understanding Business Requirement
This is one of the questions that a data scientist should ask. That is what is the objective of this project? What is my aim on analysing this data? What do I wish to predict? It is required of a data scientist or anyone that wishes to gain insight from a data raw or prepared to know what they are looking for.
### Data Acquisition
This is the Gathering of data from different sources once you know your business plan or requirement then you have to acquire the data that will be used to get this answers be it raw or prepared but in some cases that is like that of competitions like kaggle the data is already given therefore this stage can be skipped.
This can be done through web scraping, surveys and downloading data from reliable sources.
### Data Processing or cleaning
Most data that comes from real world sources usually have faulty data, missing values. This is caused maybe by human error i.e. filling wrong data or leaving a space blank or through errors in the formatting of the data it’s in this stage that data is checked and cleaned so that the model that is created can be trained on it. This stage is also one of the most time consuming stages of data science as you might be cleaning thousands of rows and features of data.
### Data Exploration
It’s in this stage that data scientist tries to understand the patterns between the features of a data and then gain useful insights on the data. 
it is also called Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
### Data Modelling
This is the building stage where data scientist builds a model that learns or trains on the data and predicts answers to the business requirement and also answers some of stage one questions. Many library’s and frameworks are used for making models examples are scikit learn, tensorflow, pytorch and so on. 
### Data Visualization
this stage can also be done when performing data exploration as it can also be used to gain insight from data it consists of plot graphs, scatter diagrams, bar and histogram diagrams, box plots, pair plots and so on.
It is also used to show readers interesting insights and relationship between features of data 
Therefore, this is an important stage of data science. Some examples of library’s and frameworks used in this stage are matplotlib and seaborn.
### Deployment and optimization
 this is the final stage and in this stage your model is has been trained but the accuracy (how well your model can predict on unseen data) needs to be tested and if the accuracy is low you need to increase this accuracy this is done through Feature Engineering methods. Then the model is deployed examples of models like this are the google search engine, the google ads system and so many more.
 ## Conclusion
 I hope you learnt something and you are intrigued about data science and wish to learn more on this vast and knowledgeable field.
